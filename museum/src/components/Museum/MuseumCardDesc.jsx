      With a history dating back to 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is
      the nation’s oldest museum with a progressive mind. Beneath its
      19th-century colonial exterior, it uses cutting-edge technology to present
      the nation’s legacy and development. Its galleries adopt
      multi-perspectives ways of presenting history and culture featuring
      important artefacts that tell the stories of Singapore and the world to
      redefine the conventional museum experience.
      <br />
      The museum is home to thought-provoking exhibitions and hosts exciting
      events all year round including the Singapore Night Festival. In 2022, it
      celebrated its 135th anniversary.
